# Board Games Repository

A comprehensive collection of classic board game implementations, designed to provide digital versions of popular strategy and casual games.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository aims to:
- Provide clean, well-documented implementations of classic board games
- Serve as a learning resource for game development and AI algorithms
- Offer a platform for experimenting with different game AI approaches
- Create a collection that's easy to extend with new games

## 🎮 Supported Games

Currently includes the following games:

### Strategy Games
- **[Chess](games/chess/)** - The classic strategic battle between two armies
- **[Checkers](games/checkers/)** - Strategic piece movement with captures and kings
- **[Go](games/go/)** - Ancient territory control game of infinite depth
- **[Backgammon](games/backgammon/)** - Strategy meets luck in this racing game

### Casual Games  
- **[Tic-Tac-Toe](games/tic-tac-toe/)** - Simple 3×3 grid connection game
- **[Connect Four](games/connect-four/)** - Drop discs to connect four in a row

### Educational Games
- **[Bever Gang](games/bever-gang/)** - 🦫 Strategic beaver building game (✅ **IMPLEMENTED**)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each game is contained in its own directory under `games/`. Visit the individual game folders to learn about specific rules, implementation details, and how to contribute.

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how you can help:

### Adding a New Game
1. Create a new directory under `games/` with your game name (use kebab-case)
2. Add a comprehensive `README.md` explaining the game rules and implementation status
3. Implement the game logic following the established patterns
4. Add tests for your implementation
5. Update this main README to include your game

### Improving Existing Games
- Enhance game logic and algorithms
- Add AI opponents with different difficulty levels
- Improve user interfaces
- Add comprehensive test coverage
- Optimize performance

### Code Guidelines
- Write clean, readable, and well-documented code
- Include unit tests for new functionality
- Follow established coding patterns within each game
- Update documentation as needed

## 📋 Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅
