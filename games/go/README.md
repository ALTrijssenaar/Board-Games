# Go (Weiqi/Baduk)

Go is an ancient strategy board game originating in China over 4,000 years ago. Players place black and white stones on a grid to control territory and capture opponent stones.

## Game Overview

- **Players**: 2
- **Board Size**: 19Ã—19 lines (also playable on 13Ã—13 or 9Ã—9)
- **Pieces**: Black and white stones
- **Objective**: Control the most territory on the board

## Rules Summary

Players alternate placing stones on line intersections. Stones are captured when completely surrounded by opponent stones with no liberties (empty adjacent points). The game ends when both players pass, and territory is counted.
